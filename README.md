# Scaling Up Staying Secure 
This repository contains the code that was made in the process of doing a Master's Thesis in Computer Science at the TU Delft in the specialization of Cyber Security.
The thesis document can be found at [link](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A0e0bb7e2-0ca8-4044-aadb-27bc200cebf8).

# Layout
The folders contained here are divided into the main model and helper modules.

## Model
This is the agent-based model that simulates the grid to determine the impact of the risk identified in the thesis.
The simulated grid is roughly the size of The Netherlands.

## Verification and Validation
To ensure the model works, the model is verified and validated using real-world data obtained from TenneT and MFFBAS.
This module will automatically download the files if needed.

## Experimentation
To create multiple grid and attack scenarios, this module can be used.
It also can be used to parse the results and extract relevant information.
